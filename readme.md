# Funj 

If you've heard of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), then you're in for a treat with 
Funj, an entirely fungible token (FT). That's right, you can copy Funj, you can divide it however you like,
there is no contract on it designating property rights. Hell, you can even copy the source code 
--send it to your mother, she's been meaning to hear from you. 

# Installation

Can be installed from source [1] via 

```commandline
pip install . 
```

# Use 

In a stunning rebuke to the labor theory of value, Funj helps us question whether the labor used in its creation or your effort in 
reading this readme produced any value. But what is value? That is a question for the philosophers. 

To print Funj tokens, simply initialize a `FunjPrinter`, whose docstring is reproducted below

```python
'''
:param token_size: int
    Size of FunjToken 2D matrix side
:param n_tokens: int
:param base_dir: PathLike (default: ".")
    Base directory to save tokens to
:param batch_size: int (default: 10)
    Number of tokens to save to directory
:param colormap: Optional[str] (default: None)
    if not None, overwrites default FunjToken colormap
'''
```

See `\examples` for examples of use. Let the Funj printer go fjjjj!

By use of Funj, no warranties are made (see LICENSE).

Any relation to the Funj sultanate is purely coincidental. 

This is a joke. Funj does not purport to be a currency, crypto or otherwise.
